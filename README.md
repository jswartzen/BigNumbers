## Problem
Find the sum of the digits of N = 9 + 99 + 999 + 99...999, with the last term in the sum containing 321 occurrences of the digit '9'.
## Answer
342
## Overview
I decided to break this solution down into three parts:
1. Write a computer program to find the answer
2. Generalize the answer to a reproducible pattern
3. Find the formula/proof to the general problem

I was a Chemistry and Math major but I've spent my entire career in software development. 
So after completing the first two parts, I stopped.
